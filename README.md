#  ðŸ’» JavaScript Account Creation and Login System

This is a simple browser-based JavaScript program that allows users to create multiple accounts with email and password, then log in using those credentials. It demonstrates input handling, validation, array storage, and condition checking using basic JavaScript.

   - User enters an email address.
   - User enters a password.
   - Email and password are validated.
   - If valid, credentials are saved to arrays.
3. After account creation, the user is prompted to log in.
